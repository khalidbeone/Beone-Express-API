## API 
<hr>

An application program interface (API) is a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications. Basically, an API specifies how software components should interact. Additionally, APIs are used when programming graphical user interface (GUI) components interact. A good API makes it easier to develop a program by providing all the building blocks. A programmer then puts the blocks together
